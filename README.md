# ESPP Master's Thesis
This project examines the "Euclidean Shortest Path Problem" and
possibilities of improving the state-of-the-art algorithms that use Pre-Computation,
the algorithms and details of the implementation is available in our paper.

This project has two parts; "Optimal Subdivision EHL" and "Neighborhood Search".
Optimal Subdivision EHL experiments with EHL on different meshes
and "Neighborhood Search" is a novel algorithm for connecting
a point to a visibility graph.
For more information on the specific parts see the README files in each directory.
